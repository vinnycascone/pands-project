## Iris dataset analysis executed by Vincenzo Cascone, student of the Higher diploma course in Science in Data Analytics at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/)

## Introduction to the dataset
My project explores the well-known Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica. The objective of the dataset is typically to classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements and can be used for various analyses tasks as it serves for it serves as a fundamental dataset for learning and practicing

## Overview of my project
This project is my hands-on exploration into data analysis using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a foundational dataset used in data science for understanding data manipulation and visualization techniques. My focus here is primarily on parsing the data effectively, visualizing various aspects of it through histograms and scatter plots, and summarizing its attributes.

## Repository Contents
