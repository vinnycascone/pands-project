    "### Output of the summary statistics of each variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that i have created has done so:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Loaded the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame (iris_df).\n",
    " - Calculated the summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for each variable using the describe() function.\n",
    " - Converted the summary statistics DataFrame to a string using to_string().\n",
    " - Specified the file path for the output text file (output_file_path).\n",
    " - Wrote the summary statistics string to the output text file.\n",
    " - Printed a message indicating the location of the saved file.\n",
    " \n",
    "After running this code, I got a text file named summary_stats.txt containing the summary statistics of each variable from the Iris dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Statistics explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "Count: This represents the number of entries (or rows) for each variable. Each feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) has 150 entries. This indicates that there are no missing values in the dataset as every column has 150 measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean gives the average value of a dataset. For example, the average sepal length is approximately 5.84, which means that, on average, the sepals of the Iris flowers in this dataset are about 5.84 cm long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Std (Standard Deviation): This measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. For instance, sepal length has a standard deviation of 0.828, suggesting moderate spread around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min (Minimum): The smallest value in each column. For example, the smallest sepal length recorded in the dataset is 4.3 cm, indicating the shortest sepal length found among all the Iris flowers measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "25% (25th Percentile): First quartile, it indicates that 25% of the values in the dataset are below this value. For petal length, 25% of the flowers have a petal length of 1.6 cm or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "50% (50th Percentile or Median): Median value of the data. Half of the data points are below this value. For sepal width, the median is 3.0 cm, which means half of the Iris flowers have a sepal width that is less than 3.0 cm, and the other half have a sepal width that is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "75% (75th Percentile): Third quartile, 75% of the data is below this value. For petal width, 75% of the flowers have a petal width that is 1.8 cm or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Max (Maximum): The largest value in the dataset. For example, the maximum petal length is 6.9 cm, which is the longest petal measured in the dataset.\n",

    "### Saved a histogram of each variable to png files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this piece of code I have loaded the dataset into a DataFrame called 'iris_df'.\n",

    "##### What are the histogram showing us?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Petal length\n",
    "\n",
    "The petal length histogram displays a clear bimodal distribution, with two prominent peaks separated by a gap. This indicates that there are two groups of Iris species with significantly different petal lengths, with very few intermediate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Petal width\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram shows the frequency distribution of petal widths. The distribution appears to be bimodal, with two distinct peaks. One peak is for smaller petal widths (suggesting one species of Iris), and another peak for larger petal widths (indicating another species). The bimodal nature suggests that petal width could be a distinguishing characteristic between species.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sepal length\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram shows a distribution that is somewhat normal but slightly skewed to the right, with a concentration of data around the mode. There's less apparent bimodality here, but there's still a possibility of overlapping sepal width measurements across Iris species.\n",

    "This scatter plot shows how sepal length varies with sepal width for the iris samples. Each point on the plot represents an iris sample, where the x-coordinate represents the sepal length and the y-coordinate represents the sepal width. This was made to check whether there is any correlation or pattern between the length and width of the sepals. In this plot we can see that as sepal length increases, sepal width tends either increase.\n",

It allows us to see if there is any correlation between the length of the sepals and the length of the petals. In this specific case it is shown a positive correlation between sepal length and petal length which indicates that longer sepals tend to be associated with longer petals.\n",

    "## Spearman Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the analysis I have calculated the Spearman correlation matrix for the numerical columns of the Iris dataset and created a heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imported seaborn lybrary to create the statistical graphics\n",
    "- Dropped Non-Numeric Column: I have used the drop() method to exclude the non-numeric column 'species' from the DataFrame iris_df\n",
    "- Calculate Spearman Correlation Matrix: numeric_data.corr(method='spearman') to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficients between pairs of numerical columns.\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Legend of the Heatmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Color Scale: The color scale on the right indicates the correlation strength, with red representing a strong positive correlation (near +1), blue representing a strong negative correlation (near -1), and white representing no correlation (near 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of the Correlations\n",
    "- Sepal Length and Petal Length (0.88): There's a strong positive correlation between sepal length and petal length. This implies that as the sepal length increases, the petal length tends to increase as well.\n",
    "- Sepal Length and Petal Width (0.83): This also shows a strong positive correlation, suggesting that larger sepal lengths are associated with wider petal widths.\n",
    "- Petal Length and Petal Width (0.94): This is one of the strongest correlations observed. It indicates a very strong positive relationship between petal length and petal width, meaning that flowers with longer petals tend to have wider petals too.\n",
    "- Sepal Width and Petal Length (-0.30), Sepal Width and Petal Width (-0.28): Both of these are negative correlations, though they are relatively weak. They suggest that as sepal width increases, both petal length and petal width slightly decrease, but the relationship is not very strong.\n",
    "- Sepal Length and Sepal Width (-0.16): This weak negative correlation indicates that there's not much of a linear relationship between sepal length and sepal width.\n",
